              <h1 id="average-scores">Average Scores</h1>
<p>The <b>Average Scores Chart</b> shows the average scores for any scale question. Use the Filters settings to choose multiple scores to report on.</p>
<h2 id="chart-types">Chart Types</h2>
<p>You add different chart types to view the same data in different ways. For example, you can track trends over time to see if you are improving and you can use the heat map across key segments to find areas of high and low performance. Click the Select Chart Type icon in the top right to change the display.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Bar Chart</i> - By default, the Average Scores Chart is a bar chart. Choose Group By options to compare the scores of different segments.</li>
  <li><i>Column Chart</i>  - Choose the column display option to turn the bar chart on its side.</li>
  <li><i>Trend</i>  - Change the display to a line chart to view the average recommend score over time. You can also add events to your trend charts,</li>
  <li><i>Heatmap</i> - Choose the Heatmap display option to get a very flexible look at your data. You can choose the value for both dimensions (for example, product over time) and quickly visualize high and low performers within your program. If you choose only one Group By, you can see multiple average scores along the Y-axis. You can use Display Settings to change the color score thresholds for the average scores to fit your targets.</li>
</ul>

<p>In bar, column, and trend view we will not show a question label in the chart until it has at least one response that matches the filter</p>

<h2 id="group-by">Group By</h2>
<p>Use the Group By options to compare the results across one or more customer segments. Learn what’s making your best performers successful so you can roll out best practices to the rest of your team.</p>

<h2 id="overall-averages">Overall Averages</h2>
<p>By default, your Average Scores chart calculates the overall score by respondent, but you can choose to report on overall score by group instead. Choose across groups if you want to show the average of the group scores regardless of the number of respondents in each group. For example, if your East segment average score is 8 and your West segment average score is 9, your Average Across Groups is 8.5 regardless of the number of respondents in each group.</p>

<p>To view Overall Score across groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Display Settings tab for your Average Scores chart.</li>
  <li>Find the Calculation for Overall Average dropdown menu under the Heatmap section.</li>
  <li>Click the dropdown menu and choose Across Groups.</li>
  <li>Click Apply &amp; Close.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="color-thresholds">Color Thresholds</h2>
<p>Recommend and Satisfaction scores have different degrees of behavioral impact, so we’ve given Satisfaction scores different thresholds to better illustrate the level of customer dissatisfaction for your staff.</p>

<p>In comment streams and response pages, respondents who provided a Satisfaction response of 5 or 6 will show a yellow face and score instead of a red face and score.
